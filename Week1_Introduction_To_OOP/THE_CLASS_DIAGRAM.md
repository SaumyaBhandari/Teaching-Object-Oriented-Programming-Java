# üìò The Class Diagram

## üîç What is a Class Diagram?

A **class diagram** is a **visual representation** of classes, objects, their attributes, methods, and relationships in an object-oriented system. It helps you **design and understand** how different parts of a program connect before you write the actual code.

Think of it as a **blueprint** for your program ‚Äî just like an architect uses building plans before construction.

## üß± Structure of a Class Diagram

A class diagram for a single class is divided into **three compartments**:

| Class Name |               |
|------------|---------------|
| **Attributes** |           |
| -attribute1    |           |
| - attribute2   |           |
| **Methods**    |           |
| - method1      |           |

You can fill it in like this, for example:

| Class Name | Fan           |
|------------|---------------|
| **Attributes** |           |
| - color     | white        |
| - speed     | 3 levels     |
| - brand     | XYZ          |
| **Methods**   |            |
| - rotate()  |              |
| - speedUp() |              |
| - stop()    |              |

Another Example:

| Class: Student                | Type       |
|------------------------------|------------|
| **Attributes**               |            |
| name                         | String     |
| age                          | int        |
| rollNumber                   | int        |
| **Methods**                  |            |
| study()                      | void       |
| submitAssignment()           | void       |
| calculateGrade()             | char       |

## üß† Why Use Class Diagrams?

- Helps plan your program visually.
- Encourages modular thinking.
- Easy to share and collaborate with team members.
- Great for documentation and understanding legacy code.
