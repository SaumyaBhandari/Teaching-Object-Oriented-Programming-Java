# ✍️ 8 Tasks to Develop Object-Oriented Thinking

## 1. Object Hunt in the Classroom
**Task:** Look around your classroom and list 5 real-world objects.  
For each object, write down:
- **Attributes (Properties):** e.g., color, size, weight
- **Behaviors (Methods):** e.g., `Fan: rotate(), speedUp()`

**Goal:** Recognize that everything around you can be modeled as an object with attributes and behaviors.

## 2. Sketch Your Favorite Object as a Class
**Task:** Choose your favorite object (a phone, bicycle, game controller, your laptop, a guitar, maybe your bike?) and draw it as a class in your notebook.  
Label:
- **Class Name**
- **Attributes (fields)**
- **Methods (functions)**

**Goal:** Visualize class structure using a familiar item.

---

## 3. Build a Class for Yourself
**Task:** Create a class called `Student` with:
- **5 attributes:** e.g., name, age, studentID, mood, marks
- **3 behaviors:** e.g., `study()`, `attendClass()`, `submitAssignment()`

**Optional:** Include default values or example data.

**Goal:** Understand how humans can also be modeled as objects.

---

## 4. Attribute vs Method Challenge
**Task:** Given objects like:
- Fan, Mobile, Cat, Book, ATM  
List:
- **5 attributes**
- **3 methods** for each

Encourage not repeating attributes/methods unless it makes sense.

**Goal:** Deepen understanding of what qualifies as a method or an attribute.

---

## 5. Encapsulation Awareness
**Task:** Ask:  
*“What information about yourself would you want to keep private, and what can be public?”*

Write it down as:

```java
class Student {
  private String password;
  public String name;
}
```
Goal: Understand data hiding and encapsulation in everyday life.

## 6. Create a Superhero Class

Task: Invent a superhero. Draw and design a class with:

Attributes: name, powerLevel, costumeColor, height, weight, gender //Use your imagination here

Methods: fly(), fight(), savePeople(), readMind(), //Use your imagination here

Goal: Make programming fun and imaginative, while reinforcing object structure.

---

## 7. Method Mind-Mapping
Task: Choose a machine or device (e.g., washing machine, ATM, remote control).
Create a mind map of all the things it can do (i.e., its methods).
Create a mind map of it's definition (i.e., it's attributes).

Goal: Visualize how objects interact with data and functionality.

---

## 8. Draw a Scene and Identify Objects
Task: Draw a simple scene (e.g., a kitchen, a street, a park, a zoo, maybe Malpi's canteen?).
Identify 5 objects in the drawing.
For each, list:
- Class name
- Attributes
- Behaviors

Goal: Encourage spatial thinking and OOP abstraction from visuals.
