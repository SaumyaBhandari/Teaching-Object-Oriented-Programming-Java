# **My First Java Program: Hello, Java!**

```java
/*
 * This is my first Java program.
 * Save this file as HelloJava.java
 */

public class HelloJava {
    /*
     * The main method is the entry point of any Java application.
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /*
         * Print a message to the console
         */
        System.out.println("Hello, Java! I'm learning Java programming.");
    }
}
```

## **Explanation**

### 1. **Multiline Comment**
```java
/*
 * This is a comment.
 * It helps explain the code.
 */
```
- Anything inside `/* ... */` is ignored by Java.
- Used to explain your code so others (or future you!) can understand it.

### 2. **Class Declaration**


```java
public class HelloJava {
    /*
     * This is the name of the class, must match the filename.
     */
}
```
- class is used to define a class in Java.
- HelloJava is the name of the class *NOTE* it must exactly match the filename (`HelloJava.java`).
- Java is case-sensitive: `HelloJava ≠ helloJava`.


### 3. **The main() Method**

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    /*
     * This is where your program will starts running.
     */
}
```

- Every Java program must have a `main()` method.
- Don’t worry about the full meaning of `public`, `static`, or `void` right now but just remember to include it in your code.


### 4. **Printing Output**


```java
System.out.println("Hello, Java! I'm learning Java programming.");
```
- `System.out.println()` prints a message to the screen.
    - The text must be in double quotes (`"..."`).
    - Every Java statement ends with a semicolon (`;`).

5. **Curly Braces `{ }`**
```java
{
    /*
     * Used to group the content of a class or method.
     */
}
```
For every `{` you open, you must close it with a `}`.


## **Steps to Compile and Run**

Assuming you have Java installed:

- Open **Command Prompt (Windows)** or **Terminal (Mac/Linux)**.

- Navigate to the folder where your `.java` file is saved.

- Compile the file:
  ```bash
  javac HelloJava.java
  ```
  This will generate `HelloJava.class`.

- Run the program:
  ```bash
  java HelloJava
  ```
  You should see:
  ```
  Hello, Java! I'm learning Java programming.
  ```
