# Basic Structure of a Java Program

Java programs follow a predictable structure that makes them easy to understand and write. Let’s break down each component step by step.

### **Class Definition**
The foundation of every Java program is the `class` definition. A class is like a blueprint for creating objects—it defines the properties (data) an object
will have and the methods it will perform.

- **What is a Class?**
  - Think of a class as a recipe or set of instructions for creating something.
  - It’s where you define how your program should behave.

- **Key Elements of a Class:**
  1. **Constructor**: A special method that initializes an object with specific values.
     - Example: `public MyClass(int age) { this.age = age; }`
  2. **Fields/Variables**: Data that the class holds, like numbers or strings.
     - Example: `private int age;` (age is a private variable)
  3. **Methods**: Functions that perform specific tasks on objects.
     - Example: `public void greet() { System.out.println("Hello!"); }`

- **Declaring a Class**:
  ```java
  public class MyClass {
      // class body containing fields, methods, etc.
  }
  ```
  - The keyword `public` makes the class accessible to other programs.

- **Why is this Important?**
  - Every Java program must have at least one class.
  - Classes are the building blocks for all objects in your program.

### **The `main()` Method**

The `main()` method is the entry point of any Java program, it’s where everything starts!

- **What is the `main()` Method?**
  - It’s a special static method (denoted by `public static void main(String[] args)`) that all classes must have.
  - It executes in the same thread as the rest of your program.

- **Structure of the `main()` Method**:
  ```java
  public static void main(String[] args) {
      // code to execute when the program starts running
      System.out.println("Hello, World!"); // This line prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
  }
  ```
  - **Parameters**: The array of strings (`String[] args`) represents command-line arguments. For simplicity, many programs ignore them in early stages.

- **Why is this Important?**
  - All Java programs must have a `main()` method; it’s the starting point!
  - The code inside `main()` will execute when your program runs.

### **Syntax Overview**

Java has specific syntax rules that every programmer must follow for correct code execution.

- **Key Rules:**
  1. **Statements End with Semicicolons**: Every statement in Java ends with a semicolon (`;`).
     - Example: `System.out.println("Hello!");`
  2. **Braces `{}` Denote Blocks**: Group related statements within curly braces `{}`.
     - Example:
       ```java
       if (age > 18) {
           System.out.println("You are an adult.");
       }
       ```
  3. **Class and Method Definitions Use Indentation**:
     - Proper indentation makes the code readable.
     - Example:
       ```java
       public class MyClass {
           // This is a method inside the class
           void myMethod() { ... }
       }
       ```

- **Why Syntax Matters**
  - Proper syntax ensures your program runs without errors.
  - Incorrect syntax can lead to runtime errors or even broken programs.

#### **3.4 Comments in Java**

Comments help make your code understandable and maintainable by adding explanations or notes.

- **What Are Comments?**
  - Comments are lines of code that don’t execute when the program runs but provide insights for readers.

- **Types of Comments:**
  1. **Single-Line Comment**: Begins with `//` and continues until the end of the line.
     - Example:
       ```java
       // This is a single-line comment explaining what myMethod() does.
       the single line comment doesn't work for this line...
       ```
  2. **Multi-Line Comment**: Uses the Java block comment `/* */`.
     - Example:
       ```java
       /*
        This is a multi-line comment that
        spans multiple
        lines 
       */
       ```

- **Why Use Comments?**
  - They make your code more readable for others (and even future versions of yourself!).
  - They’re useful for explaining complex logic, debugging, or temporarily disabling parts of your code.

#### **3.5 Naming Conventions**

Java has specific naming conventions for classes, variables, and other elements to ensure consistency and readability.

- **Class Naming Convention**:
  - **Conventions**: Use **PascalCase** or also called Upper CamelCase (e.g., `ClassName`).
     - Example: `Person name = "John";`
     - `class Window`
     - `class WaterBottleHolder`
     - `class FrontDesk`
  - **Rules**:
     - Use letters, instead of alphanumeric characters. use `class TwoNumbers` instead of `class 2Numbers`.
     - Avoid spaces or underscores in class names.

- **Variable and Constant Naming Conventions**:
  - **Variables**:
     - Use camelCase (e.g., `varName`).
     - Example: `int age = 25;`
     - `String firstName = "Saumya";`
     - `String lastName = "Bhandari";`
     - `bool hasPets = true;`
     - `int washingMachineManufacturerNumber = 4434543;`
  - **Constants/Keywords**:
     - Use all caps with underscores if needed, but Java reserves certain words like `public`, `private`, and keywords
for specific purposes.
     - Example: `private int _age;`

- **Method Naming Convention**:
  - Use camelCase (e.g., `methodName`).
  - Example: `void greetUser() { ... }`

### **Summary of Key Takeaways**

1. **Class Definition**: Every Java program starts with a class, which defines the structure and behavior of objects.
2. **main() Method**: This is the entry point where everything begins; all classes must have it.
3. **Java Syntax**: Proper syntax ensures correct code execution and readability.
4. **Comments**: Enhance understanding by providing explanations or notes in your code.
5. **Naming Conventions**: Consistent naming makes your code readable and maintainable.

### **Interactive Exercise: Writing Your First Java Program**

Now that you’ve learned these concepts, try writing your own Java program! Here's a simple template to get started:

```java
// Comments can help explain your code.
// This is an example of using a comment to explain the structure.

public class MyFirstProgram {
    // Field declaration: holds age as an integer.
    private int age;

    // Constructor: initializes the field on object creation.
    public MyFirstProgram(int initialAge) {
        this.age = initialAge;
    }

    // Method name: displays a friendly message.
    public void displayMessage() {
        System.out.println("Welcome to Java Programming!");
    }

    // main() method: executes when the program starts.
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyFirstProgram myProgram = new MyFirstProgram(25); // Create an object
        myProgram.displayMessage(); // Call the method
    }
}
```

Compile and run this code (using a Java IDE or online compiler). Observe what happens when you change different parts,
like `initialAge` in the constructor.
