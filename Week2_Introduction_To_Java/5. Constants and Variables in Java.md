## 4. Variables and Constants

Variables are fundamental elements in programming that allow storage of data values which can be modified
during program execution. They serve as named references to memory locations where data is stored,
enabling efficient manipulation of data within programs.

### 4.1 Declaring Variables

A variable must have a name (an identifier) before it can be used in a program. Identifiers are
case-sensitive and follow specific naming conventions for readability and consistency.

- **Java Example:**
```java
int count = 0; // Integer type, named "count", initialized to 0
String name; // String type, named "name", no explicit initialization
```

Here, `count` is an integer variable holding the value `0`, and `name` is a string variable storing `"John
Doe"`. Variables are declared with their types (e.g., `int`, `String`) followed by the variable name.

### 4.2 Initialization

Variables must be initialized before they can hold meaningful values; this is called explicit
initialization. Failure to initialize a variable may result in runtime errors or undefined behavior.

- **Java Example:**
```java
public class LectureNotes {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int count = 0; // Explicit initialization with an initial value

        if (count > 10) {
            System.out.println("Count exceeds 10");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Count is " + count);
        }
    }
}
```

In the example above, `count` is explicitly initialized to `0`. If the program attempts to use `count`
before this line, a runtime error may occur.

### 4.3 Constants using `final` Keyword

Java provides a way to define constantsâ€”variables whose values cannot be changed after assignment. The
keyword `final` is used in conjunction with variable declarations to create constants.

- **Java Example:**
```java
public class LectureNotes {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final int MAX = 10; // Constants must have explicit initialization
        System.out.println("MAX value: " + MAX);

        try {
            MAX = 20; // This line will throw a compile-time error because `MAX` is declared as `final`
        } catch (CompileTimeException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: Cannot reassign constant `MAX`");
        }
    }
}
```

In the example, `MAX` is a constant integer with an initial value of `10`. Once declared, its value cannot
be changed.

### 4.4 Scope and Lifetime

Java's scoping rules determine where variables can be accessed within a program:

- **Local Variables:**
  - Declared inside method definitions or control structures (e.g., loops, conditionals).
  - Accessible only within the scope of their declaration.

  ```java
  public class LectureNotes {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          int count = 5; // Local variable

          System.out.println("Count in method: " + count);

          if (count > 10) {
              System.out.println("Incrementing count..."); // Compilation error
          }
      }
      public void increment() { // Method with a local variable `count`
          static int count = 0; // Static initializers can change the value of a static variable
          count++;
      }
  }
  ```

- **Static Variables:**
  - Declared using the keyword `static`.
  - Accessible throughout the class and are initialized once.

  ```java
  public class LectureNotes {
      private static int STATIC_COUNT = 0; // Static, final variable

      public void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println("STATIC_COUNT: " + STATIC_COUNT);

          if (STATIC_COUNT > 5) {
              staticIncrement(); // Calls a method that increments STATIC_COUNT
          }

          System.out.println("STATIC_COUNT after incrementing: " + STATIC_COUNT);
      }

      public void staticIncrement() {
          static STATIC_COUNT++; // Increments the static variable
      }
  }
  ```

- ** instance Variables:**
  - Declared without the `static` keyword.
  - Created for each object instance and have their own scope.

### Key Takeaways:
- **Variables:** Used when values need to be changed during runtime. They provide flexibility in data
manipulation but require careful management through initialization and reassignment.
- **Constants (`final` Variables):** Used when a value must remain unchanged throughout the program's
execution. They enhance code reliability by preventing accidental modification of fixed values.
- **Scope and Lifetime:** Understanding variable scope (local vs. static) is essential for managing memory
efficiently and avoiding unexpected variable interactions.
