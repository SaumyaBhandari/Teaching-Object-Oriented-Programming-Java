## Unit VIII: Generics - Enhancing Code Flexibility and Type Safety

Welcome to Unit VIII, where we delve into **Generics**, a powerful feature in Java designed to make your code more flexible, reusable, and significantly safer. Imagine crafting tools that can adeptly handle any material, rather than being limited to just one specific type. That's the essence of Generics!

### Objectives for Today:

By the conclusion of this unit, you will be able to:

* **Understand the compelling advantages of Generics** and how they streamline the development process.
* **Create Generic Classes**, serving as versatile blueprints for objects capable of holding diverse data types.
* **Write Generic Methods**, enabling your functions to operate across various data types without constant re-implementation.
* **Utilize Generic Constructors** for the effortless creation of generic objects.
* **Appreciate the seamless integration of Polymorphism** (a familiar concept) with Generics.

Let's begin!

### 8.1 Advantages of Using Generics: Why Bother?

Consider the task of constructing a specialized container for holding items.

**Without Generics:** You'd be compelled to construct a separate container for pens, another for pencils, yet another for erasers, and so forth. Ensuring that only pens entered the pen container would necessitate manual verification of each item. This mirrors the laborious process of writing distinct code for `ArrayList<String>`, `ArrayList<Integer>`, etc., and contending with the `Object` class and cumbersome type casting.

**With Generics:** You design one intelligent container. When you create a new container, you simply declare: "This container is exclusively for pens!" or "This container is exclusively for erasers!" The container then automatically ensures that only appropriate items are placed inside, and upon retrieval, you inherently know the item's type. This exemplifies the remarkable utility of Generics!

Let's formally explore these advantages:

#### Type Safety (The Paramount Benefit!):

**Without Generics (The Traditional Approach):** Prior to Generics (Java 5 and earlier), creating a list capable of holding any data type involved using `ArrayList` (which internally stored `Object` instances).

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class OldWayExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList myStuff = new ArrayList(); // This list can hold anything!
        myStuff.add("Hello");             // Adding a String
        myStuff.add(123);                 // Adding an Integer (oops!)
        myStuff.add(true);                // Adding a Boolean

        // Now, when you get something out, Java doesn't know what it is!
        // You have to tell it, which is risky.
        String s = (String) myStuff.get(0); // OK
        // Integer i = (Integer) myStuff.get(1); // OK
        // Boolean b = (Boolean) myStuff.get(2); // OK

        // What if you make a mistake?
        // String wrongS = (String) myStuff.get(1); // This will CRASH at runtime!
        // It's an Integer, but you're trying to treat it as a String.
    }
}
```

**Problem:** This code compiles successfully, but it results in a runtime crash! Such an error, occurring during program execution, can be notoriously difficult to locate and rectify.

**With Generics (The Modern Approach):** You specify the exact data type an `ArrayList` will hold at the moment of its creation.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class NewWayExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // This list can ONLY hold Strings. Java will enforce this.
        ArrayList<String> myStrings = new ArrayList<String>();
        myStrings.add("Hello Generics!");
        // myStrings.add(123); // Compiler ERROR! You can't add an Integer here.
                            // Java tells you the error RIGHT AWAY, at compile time!

        String s = myStrings.get(0); // No need for casting! Java already knows it's a String.
        System.out.println(s);
    }
}
```

**Benefit:** Generics empower you to identify errors *before* your program even executes. This **compile-time safety** is paramount for developing robust and reliable code.

#### Elimination of Type Casting:

As demonstrated, the adoption of Generics obviates the need for manual type casting of objects retrieved from generic collections. Java inherently understands the type, leading to cleaner, more readable code and a significant reduction in `ClassCastException` errors.

#### Code Reusability:

Consider the need for a class capable of storing pairs of items, such as a `Pair<String, Integer>` (representing a name and an age) or `Pair<Book, Author>` (associating a book object with its author object).

**Without Generics:** You'd be compelled to write `StringIntegerPair`, `BookAuthorPair`, and so forth, leading to extensive code duplication.

**With Generics:** You implement a single `Pair` class, which can then be utilized with any desired types.

```java
// We'll see how to write this in the next section!
Pair<String, Integer> studentInfo = new Pair<>("Samikshya", 20);
Pair<Double, Double> coordinates = new Pair<>(10.5, 20.3);
```

This approach significantly conserves development time and enhances code maintainability.

### 8.2 Generic Classes: Building Flexible Blueprints

A **generic class** functions much like a standard class, but it incorporates one or more **type parameters** declared within angle brackets (`<>`) immediately following the class name. These type parameters serve as placeholders for the actual data types you will specify when instantiating an object of that class.

Consider this analogy:

A conventional `StringBox` class can only contain `String` objects:

```java
class StringBox {
    private String content;

    public StringBox(String content) {
        this.content = content;
    }

    public String getContent() {
        return content;
    }
}
```

If you require a box for `Integer` objects, you'd be forced to write an entirely new class: `IntegerBox`.

A **Generic Box** class, however, acts as a universal container. You specify its contents when creating a new instance:

```java
// <T> is the type parameter. 'T' is a common convention for "Type".
// You could use any letter, like <E> for Element, <K> for Key, <V> for Value.
class GenericBox<T> {
    private T content; // 'T' is now a placeholder for ANY type

    public GenericBox(T content) {
        this.content = content;
    }

    public T getContent() {
        return content;
    }

    public void showContentType() {
        System.out.println("Content type: " + content.getClass().getName());
    }
}
```

#### How to Use a Generic Class:

When instantiating an object of a generic class, you substitute the type parameter with a concrete data type (such as `String`, `Integer`, `Double`, or even your own custom classes).

```java
public class GenericClassExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Box specifically for Strings
        GenericBox<String> stringBox = new GenericBox<>("Hello Kathmandu!");
        System.out.println("String Box Content: " + stringBox.getContent());
        stringBox.showContentType();

        // Create a Box specifically for Integers
        GenericBox<Integer> integerBox = new GenericBox<>(12345);
        System.out.println("Integer Box Content: " + integerBox.getContent());
        integerBox.showContentType();

        // Create a Box specifically for Doubles
        GenericBox<Double> doubleBox = new GenericBox<>(3.14159);
        System.out.println("Double Box Content: " + doubleBox.getContent());
        doubleBox.showContentType();

        // Important: You cannot use primitive types (like int, double, boolean) directly
        // with Generics. You must use their Wrapper classes (Integer, Double, Boolean).
        // GenericBox<int> primitiveBox = new GenericBox<>(10); // COMPILE ERROR!
    }
}
```

#### Key Points about Type Parameters:

* **Naming Convention:** Single uppercase letters are conventionally employed for type parameters (e.g., **T** for Type, **E** for Element, **K** for Key, **V** for Value, **N** for Number, **S** for String, **U**, **V**).
* **Only Reference Types:** You **cannot** use primitive data types (such as `int`, `double`, `boolean`, `char`) as type arguments. You must utilize their corresponding **wrapper classes** (`Integer`, `Double`, `Boolean`, `Character`). This is because Generics operate with objects, and primitive types are not objects. Java's autoboxing/unboxing feature often masks this detail, but it's a crucial distinction.

#### More Complex Generic Class Example: A Pair Class

Let's revisit our `Pair` class. This class will encapsulate two items, potentially of different types.

```java
class Pair<K, V> { // K for Key, V for Value (common for map-like structures)
    private K key;
    private V value;

    public Pair(K key, V value) {
        this.key = key;
        this.value = value;
    }

    public K getKey() {
        return key;
    }

    public V getValue() {
        return value;
    }

    public void printPair() {
        System.out.println("Key: " + key + ", Value: " + value);
    }
}

public class GenericPairExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // A pair of String and Integer (e.g., Student Name and Age)
        Pair<String, Integer> student1 = new Pair<>("Ramesh", 21);
        student1.printPair();

        // A pair of Double and String (e.g., Latitude and City Name)
        Pair<Double, String> location = new Pair<>(27.7172, "Kathmandu");
        location.printPair();

        // A pair of two custom objects (e.g., a Book and its Author)
        class Book {
            String title;
            public Book(String title) { this.title = title; }
            public String toString() { return "Book: " + title; }
        }
        class Author {
            String name;
            public Author(String name) { this.name = name; }
            public String toString() { return "Author: " + name; }
        }

        Pair<Book, Author> bookDetails = new Pair<>(new Book("Generics Fun"), new Author("A. Clever Programmer"));
        bookDetails.printPair();
    }
}
```

This exemplifies the remarkable power of reusability afforded by generic classes!

### 8.3 Generic Methods: Functions for Any Type!

Just as you can define generic classes, you can also define **generic methods**. These methods introduce their own type parameters, enabling them to operate on arguments of varying types.

#### Why Use Generic Methods?

Consider the desire for a method to print any array.

**Without Generic Method:**

```java
public class NonGenericMethod {
    public static void printStringArray(String[] array) {
        for (String element : array) {
            System.out.print(element + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }

    public static void printIntegerArray(Integer[] array) {
        for (Integer element : array) {
            System.out.print(element + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
    // ... and so on for every type you need! Lots of duplicate code.
}
```

**With Generic Method:** One method to rule them all!

```java
public class GenericMethodExample {

    // <T> before the return type indicates that this is a generic method
    // T is the type parameter for this method.
    public static <T> void printArray(T[] array) {
        for (T element : array) {
            System.out.print(element + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Integer[] intArray = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
        Double[] doubleArray = {1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4};
        Character[] charArray = {'J', 'A', 'V', 'A'};
        String[] stringArray = {"Hello", "From", "Kathmandu"};

        System.out.print("Integer Array: ");
        printArray(intArray); // Java infers T to be Integer

        System.out.print("Double Array: ");
        printArray(doubleArray); // Java infers T to be Double

        System.out.print("Character Array: ");
        printArray(charArray); // Java infers T to be Character

        System.out.print("String Array: ");
        printArray(stringArray); // Java infers T to be String
    }
}
```

**How it works:** The `<T>` placed before the return type (`void` in this instance) declares `T` as a type parameter specifically for this method. When you invoke `printArray(intArray)`, Java "infers" that `T` should be `Integer`. Similarly, when `printArray(stringArray)` is called, `T` becomes `String`.

#### Another Example: Finding the Max Element (with Bounds)

Occasionally, you'll want your generic method to operate exclusively with specific types of objects. For example, if you're seeking the maximum element, the elements must be comparable. This is where **bounded type parameters** become essential.

We utilize the `extends` keyword within the type parameter declaration.

```java
public class BoundedGenericMethodExample {

    // <T extends Comparable<T>> means T must be a class that implements the Comparable interface.
    // This ensures we can call the compareTo method on objects of type T.
    public static <T extends Comparable<T>> T findMax(T x, T y) {
        // x.compareTo(y) returns:
        //  < 0 if x is less than y
        //  > 0 if x is greater than y
        //  = 0 if x is equal to y
        if (x.compareTo(y) > 0) {
            return x;
        } else {
            return y;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Max of 5 and 10: " + findMax(5, 10)); // T is Integer
        System.out.println("Max of 'apple' and 'orange': " + findMax("apple", "orange")); // T is String
        System.out.println("Max of 3.14 and 2.71: " + findMax(3.14, 2.71)); // T is Double

        // We can't call findMax with types that don't implement Comparable,
        // unless they are explicitly designed to be compared.
        // For example, if you had a custom "Student" class that didn't implement Comparable,
        // you couldn't use it here without modifying the Student class or providing a custom Comparator.
    }
}
```

**Explanation of `<T extends Comparable<T>>`:**

* **`T`**: The type parameter.
* **`extends`**: In the context of generics, `extends` signifies "can be this type or a subtype of this type" for classes, and "implements this interface" for interfaces.
* **`Comparable<T>`**: This is the interface that objects must implement to be comparable. `Comparable<T>` implies that objects can be compared to other objects of type `T`. For instance, an `Integer` can be compared to another `Integer`, and a `String` to another `String`.

This construct guarantees that the `compareTo` method is accessible and safely invokable on `x` and `y`.

### 8.4 Generic Constructors: Building Generic Objects

A constructor can also be generic, meaning it can possess its own type parameters. However, this is a less frequent occurrence compared to generic classes or methods.

**Important Note:** The type parameter for a generic constructor is distinct from the type parameters of the class to which it belongs.

#### Example of a Generic Constructor:

Let's revisit our `GenericBox` class, but this time, let's envision a scenario where the box can be constructed from an `Integer` and subsequently stores a `String` representation of that integer internally. While a somewhat contrived example, it effectively illustrates the concept.

```java
class SmartBox<T> {
    private T content;

    // This is a normal constructor, using the class's type parameter 'T'.
    public SmartBox(T content) {
        this.content = content;
    }

    // This is a GENERIC CONSTRUCTOR. It has its own type parameter <U>.
    // It can accept an argument of type U, and then assign it to the 'content'
    // after some processing.
    public <U> SmartBox(U specialContent, String message) {
        // For demonstration, let's say we always store a String.
        // This is where you'd convert U to T if needed.
        // For simplicity, let's just convert U to String for this example.
        // Note: This example is for illustrating a generic constructor's syntax.
        // In real-world, you'd likely ensure type compatibility between U and T.
        this.content = (T) (specialContent.toString() + " - " + message);
        // The cast (T) is required because specialContent.toString() returns String,
        // and 'content' is of type T. This assumes T is compatible with String.
        // If T was Integer, this would lead to a ClassCastException at runtime.
        // This highlights the potential pitfalls if not used carefully!
    }

    public T getContent() {
        return content;
    }

    public void showContentType() {
        System.out.println("Content type: " + content.getClass().getName());
    }
}

public class GenericConstructorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using the normal constructor of SmartBox<String>
        SmartBox<String> box1 = new SmartBox<>("Initial String");
        System.out.println("Box 1 Content: " + box1.getContent()); // Output: Initial String
        box1.showContentType();

        // Using the generic constructor.
        // The constructor's type parameter <U> will be inferred as Integer here.
        // The class's type parameter <T> is String in this case.
        SmartBox<String> box2 = new SmartBox<>(123, "Converted from Integer");
        System.out.println("Box 2 Content: " + box2.getContent()); // Output: 123 - Converted from Integer
        box2.showContentType();

        // Another example: using the generic constructor with a Double, where T is also String
        SmartBox<String> box3 = new SmartBox<>(987.65, "From Double");
        System.out.println("Box 3 Content: " + box3.getContent()); // Output: 987.65 - From Double
        box3.showContentType();

        // What if the class's type parameter T is Integer?
        // This is tricky because our generic constructor converts to String.
        // This will compile but throw a ClassCastException if T is Integer and the cast fails.
        // SmartBox<Integer> box4 = new SmartBox<>(456, "Should be Integer"); // ClassCastException at runtime
        // System.out.println("Box 4 Content: " + box4.getContent());
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

* Observe the `<U>` preceding the constructor name `SmartBox(U specialContent, String message)`. This declaration designates it as a generic constructor with its own distinct type parameter `U`.
* The class `SmartBox` itself is generic, with the type parameter `T`.
* The generic constructor can accept an argument of type `U`, which may differ from `T`.
* Within the constructor, a conversion is performed. In a practical scenario, you would exercise extreme caution to ensure type compatibility between `U` and `T` if you are assigning `U`'s value to a field of type `T`. In our illustrative example, we convert `U` to its `String` representation and store it in `content`, which is of type `T`. If `T` were `Integer`, a `String` cannot be cast to an `Integer`, leading to a `ClassCastException` at runtime.

#### When are Generic Constructors Useful?

They are rarely employed in isolation for creating objects of a generic type, as the class's own generic parameters typically suffice. However, they can prove beneficial in specific circumstances, particularly when:

* You need to construct an object of a generic type from a different, specific type.
* You are executing a particular type conversion or processing during object creation that depends on the constructor's input type, which is independent of the class's generic type.

They are more frequently encountered in highly advanced scenarios or within intricate libraries. For the majority of your daily programming endeavors, generic classes and methods will serve as your primary tools.

### 8.5 Polymorphism in Generics: How They Play Together

You are familiar with **polymorphism**: the characteristic of an object to assume multiple forms. Specifically, you understand **subtype polymorphism**, where an object of a subclass can be referenced by a superclass type.

Does polymorphism operate directly with generics? Not precisely as you might anticipate!

Let's consider `ArrayList`:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List; // List is an interface, ArrayList implements List

public class GenericPolymorphismExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Standard Polymorphism: A List<String> can be referred to by a List<String> reference.
        // This is fine.
        List<String> stringList = new ArrayList<String>();
        stringList.add("Apple");
        System.out.println(stringList);

        // Can an ArrayList<Integer> be assigned to an ArrayList<Number>?
        // NO! This is a common misconception.
        // ArrayList<Number> numbers = new ArrayList<Integer>(); // COMPILE ERROR!
        // Even though Integer is a subtype of Number, ArrayList<Integer> is NOT a subtype of ArrayList<Number>.
        // Why?
        // Imagine if it was allowed:
        // numbers.add(3.14); // This would be allowed if the assignment worked, because 3.14 is a Number.
        // But the underlying list is ArrayList<Integer>, so adding a Double would break type safety!
        // Generics are all about compile-time type safety. If this were allowed,
        // it would reintroduce the very runtime errors generics were designed to prevent.

        // So, how do we achieve some form of "polymorphism" with generics?
        // We use WILDCARDS! (Not part of the core Generics Unit, but important for polymorphism)
        // Wildcards allow for more flexible assignments.

        // Bounded Wildcard: Upper Bounded Wildcard (<? extends Type>)
        // <? extends Number> means "any type that is Number or a subtype of Number"
        List<? extends Number> numbersExtended = new ArrayList<Integer>(); // OK!
        // numbersExtended.add(10); // COMPILE ERROR! You cannot add to a List with <? extends T>
                                   // Why? Because you don't know the exact type. It could be Integer, Double, etc.
                                   // If it was Integer, adding a Double would be bad.
                                   // You can ONLY retrieve elements, and they will be treated as Number.
        Number num = numbersExtended.get(0); // OK, retrieved element is treated as Number.
        System.out.println("Retrieved from numbersExtended (Integer): " + num);

        numbersExtended = new ArrayList<Double>(); // Also OK!
        num = numbersExtended.get(0); // This would throw IndexOutOfBoundsException if list is empty.
        // So, if numbersExtended had content:
        // System.out.println("Retrieved from numbersExtended (Double): " + numbersExtended.get(0));

        // When to use <? extends T> (PECS: Producer Extends, Consumer Super)
        // Use <? extends T> when you are only READING (producing) elements from the list.

        // Example: Method to print a list of any type that extends Number
        printNumbers(new ArrayList<Integer>());
        printNumbers(new ArrayList<Double>());
    }

    // This method can accept a List of Integer, List of Double, List of Number, etc.
    public static void printNumbers(List<? extends Number> list) {
        System.out.println("\nPrinting list with <? extends Number>:");
        if (list.isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println("List is empty.");
            return;
        }
        for (Number n : list) {
            System.out.print(n + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}
```

#### The Rule for Generics and Subtyping:

If `S` is a subtype of `T`, then `List<S>` is **NOT** a subtype of `List<T>`.

This principle is absolutely critical for maintaining **type safety**. If `List<S>` were a subtype of `List<T>`, you could inadvertently insert objects of type `T` (which might not be `S`) into a `List<S>`, thereby compromising the type guarantees.

#### Wildcards (?) - A Glimpse (for Advanced Polymorphism with Generics)

While `ArrayList<Integer>` is not a subtype of `ArrayList<Number>`, we can achieve more flexible method parameters through the use of **wildcards**:

* **Upper Bounded Wildcard: `<? extends Type>`**
    * Signifies "any type that is `Type` or a subtype of `Type`".
    * **Example:** `List<? extends Number>` can contain `List<Integer>`, `List<Double>`, `List<Float>`, etc.
    * **Rule:** You can **read** elements from such a list (they will be treated as `Number` in this case), but you generally **cannot add** elements to it (with the exception of `null`) because the exact underlying type is unknown. This ensures type safety.
    * **Mnemonic:** "Producer Extends" (PECS) - if you are **producing** (reading) elements from the collection, use `extends`.

* **Lower Bounded Wildcard: `<? super Type>`**
    * Signifies "any type that is `Type` or a supertype of `Type`".
    * **Example:** `List<? super Integer>` can contain `List<Integer>`, `List<Number>`, `List<Object>`.
    * **Rule:** You can **add** elements of type `Integer` (or its subtypes) to this list, because any `Integer` can be stored in `Integer`, `Number`, or `Object` lists. You can only read elements back as `Object`.
    * **Mnemonic:** "Consumer Super" (PECS) - if you are **consuming** (adding) elements to the collection, use `super`.

* **Unbounded Wildcard: `<?>`**
    * Signifies "any type".
    * **Example:** `List<?>` can contain `List<String>`, `List<Integer>`, `List<Object>`, etc.
    * You can only read elements as `Object`. You cannot add any non-null elements.

* That `List<Subtype>` is **not** a subtype of `List<Supertype>`. This represents the fundamental divergence from conventional polymorphism.
* The underlying reason for this (type safety).
* That wildcards (`<? extends T>`, `<? super T>`) exist to address this limitation and provide the means for flexible generic methods and assignments. While mastering wildcards isn't an immediate requirement, recognize that they offer the solution for achieving more adaptable generic assignments and method parameters.

### Conclusion

Generics constitute a cornerstone of contemporary Java programming. They empower you to craft safer, more reusable, and impeccably clean code by enabling the definition of classes, interfaces, and methods with type parameters. While polymorphism with generics necessitates the use of wildcards, a firm grasp of the fundamental principles of type safety and code reusability will undoubtedly pave your path to success.
